abstract = "This paper provides a novel method to prevent the fishermen from knowingly or unknowingly trawl (fishing) across the National Sea Border. Approximately 87 Indian fishermen have been killed by Sri Lankan Navy in a span of a decade from August 2002 to August 2012. This method makes use of Global Positioning System (GPS) which provides reliable positioning, navigation and timing services under on a continuous basis. The existing system does not satisfy the safety requirement of fishermen as the maritime boundary of a country cannot be marked. The main motive behind this paper is to implement an efficient scheme to preserve the safety of the fishermen using GPS. The Boat Unit installed in each boat continuously retrieves its GPS coordinates and calculates the distance between the boat and the stored values of the maritime border. When the distance between the boat and the border is below the reference value, an alarm is triggered in the boat. When the distance between boat and border further decreases to a minimum value the coordinates of the boat is sent to the main server by the GSM module. The main server forwards the location to the nearest available Coast Guard patrol boat using GSM. The CG (Coast Guard) Unit on the patrol boat plots the path to the fishing boat on its display. This system can also be used by the fishermen to alert the Coast Guard on sighting an intruder. The Boat Unit radiates the information containing GPS coordinates of the intruder to the nearest Coast Guard station through the main server. This system thus provides life security to the fisherman and also enables the fishing community to serve as a surveillance unit."
