I'm **Mahesh Sudhakar**, a recent M.Eng graduate from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Toronto. My graduate degree specialization was on Computer Vision, Perception, Robotics, and Machine Learning. I have 2+ years of full-time work experience as a backend software developer.\
\
Currently, I'm working as a Research Associate at [Bell Multimedia Laboratory](http://www.dsp.utoronto.ca/ "Bell Lab"), on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), intending to decode deep residual Machine Learning classification and detection models at the kernel level by developing novel algorithms to visualize the activation maps and investigating their corresponding super-pixels for steel surface detection. I also work on the student team of [aUToronto](https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca/ "autodrive") - U of T's self-driving car project, as Simulation and Experimentation Engineer.
