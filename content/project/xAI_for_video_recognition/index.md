* Researching some {{< hl >}}(xAI methods){{< /hl >}} for time series data. Eg: video action recognition.
* Implementing **GradCAM**, **Contrastive Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (CLRP)**, **Deep Taylor Decomposition** algorithms for visualizing **heat map** (target feature map) that pretrained deep learning model focused on.
* Implementing some proposed xAI related approaches that can improve accuracy of the pretrained model.
