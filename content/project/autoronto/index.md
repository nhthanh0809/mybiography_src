Worked in the Simulation and Experimentation team of <a href="https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">**aUToronto**</a> 
(U of Tâ€™s self driving car team &amp; Winner of first two years of <a href="https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events/autodrive-challenge/" 
target="_blank">SAE/GM AutoDrive challenge</a>), building virtual scenarios for the ego vehicle to drive through, thereby 
testing the pedestrian detection and tracking algorithm 
by exporting the sensor data to ROS environment. This is one of the important module of third year's **MathWorks Simulation Challenge**.
