* Worked in the Simulation and Experimentation team of <a href="https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">**aUToronto**</a> 
{{< hl >}}(U of Tâ€™s self driving car team){{< /hl >}}.

* **Zeus** - Student built self driving car is the `WINNER` of all 4 years of <a href="https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events/autodrive-challenge/" target="_blank">SAE/GM AutoDrive challenge</a>).

* I designed and built `virtual scenarios` for the ego vehicle to drive through for the **MathWorks Simulation Challenge**, thereby testing the pedestrian detection and tracking stack by exporting the virtual sensor data to `ROS` environment.
